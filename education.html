	<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;"> This is my primary school. Sekolah Kebangsaan Meru 2 in Klang, Selangor. I do not own any photo of my kindergarden to show. It's okay I'll just continue with my primary school where everything starts. To be honest, this place is not one of the places that I miss but it's just a place that educate me to keep learning and here I am writing this in university. There are so many things happened that I don't want to remember at all. </p>

	<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;"> This is my secondary school. Sekolah Agama Menengah Nurul Iman in Klang, Selangor. Known as SAMNI. I think I love this school better. I made a lot of friends there. I also meet good friends that I can talk to until now. This school taught me so many things from the religion things to the life education. </p>

	<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;"> Trust me, I love my University era so bad! I love my friends and my lecturers. Please I not try to begging Miss Aina for marks HAHAHAHA but this is my honest feedbacks. I love the scenary each time I go to campus for class. It is a super expensive experiences, I do enjoy to walk around the campus. It looks like paradise of green. So calm, the air so fresh. Sadly, I am going to end my diploma too soon. I don't know if I will get the chance to have something like this in future. I could be different, I am going to miss everything here in less than a month. Dear, friends! I am going to miss you all! I miss to dress up early in the morning for class, and walking while put earphone and listening to <a href="https://music.youtube.com/">YouTube Music.</a> Perpustakaan Tengku Anis (PTA) my favorite place to study. My favorite waffel from the small stall at Block D. I totally going to miss everything. Thank you <a href="https://kelantan.uitm.edu.my/index.php/en/">UiTM Machang, Kelantan</a> for all those memories. I appreciate it so much!</p>
