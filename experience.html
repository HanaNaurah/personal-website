	<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;">My experience of working really taught me to be tough and mature in life. There were so many things hapenned  for a month I working there. How people actually can treat you as bad as they can, we could not assume people will always do kind with us no matter how kind us to them. That time I was 17 with ZERO experience of working anywhere and I was hoping my first experience will be the best things I ever felt but I realized that I was wrong. Fortunately, there are few things I think it really helps me today by working there which are it improves my communication skill and how in handling my anger as well as be kind with people who deserve it. Working is something that need people to work hard. It is also taught me that to get money to purchase anything that I want need hustle. Now, I do understand how hard my parents struggle to get money. At the same time, I knew the cruelty is exist in this world ;( </p>

	<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;">Every semester break, I used to do part-time job by working as promoter at random booth in shopping mall. All I can say is working at the booth is much relax when I could sit when there is no customer. The stock of clothes also not as much as at the outlet. </p>

	<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;">I am so excited to story this! Last 5 January 2023, my classmates and I visited SK Hamzah 1, Machang to do our outreach programme for IMD314 that gave me chances in handling and communicating with kids. To be honest, I still can not move on with them. Those experiences really touche me and make me realize that this programme is needed to spread awareness towards the importances of knowledge. As a student of Information Management, I feel responsible in making sure that people concern about how and where to get the accurate and authoritative knowledge.</p>
