	<center><img src="images/photo18.jpg" style="width: 1100px; height: 800px;"></center>

	<center><p><b>I don't know where to start!</b></p></center>

	<br>

	<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;"> I'm sorry if the image might looks incomplete but this is the only thing that I can show you. Alright! Let's start from the left picture. My eldest sister, Eshal Nafisah. Please do not tell others that she is my favorite sister ever! HAHAHA. I never saying this to her but this is the only chance that I have to express my feelings. She is the one that never complain if I used to ask her helps. She sacrificed everything to give their siblings the best. I know sometimes she hurts her own feelings to put her family first. I really hope oneday, Allah will repays her with more than she deserves. </p>

	<br>

	<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;"> The second person in the picture is my brother-in-law (husband of my eldest sister). He is the calmest one in the family. I dont even know how can he can be that one, while the others are super energetic just like a tarzan in Amazon. HAHAHA please I'm joking but it's true actually ;). </p>

	<br>

	<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;"> That is my second elder brother (the third one in siblings). What can I say about him is he is the weirdest in family. Why? I don't know but he loves talking nonsense and do something that annoyed others. </p>

	<br>

	<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;"> This man obviously just got married and this is my eldest brother (the second one after my eldest sister). I never describe him anywhere but all I can say is he is such a good man and very responsible for his family. He's such a head and father to me. He never shows that he is actually care about me but since I stay far from home, sometimes he does call me and ask if I have enough money. Since he is belong to someone else, I felt like I lost him because he is my enemy and rowdy friend back then. Never mind! I know its just human life cycle that I need to learn to accept.</p>

	<br>

	<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;"> My favourite person in the world! Of course, my mom. My paradise that Allah lets me borrow for a while in this short life. I hope she will always be my mom forever anywhere anythime. No one can fights me that mom is someone that if you loss her, you will loss yourself as well. I could not imagine how can I continue my life without her around. I might loss interest in life. She is one of the strong women I ever seen. Her smile enough for me to be happy. I try so hard to make her happy, I learn so bad to put smile on her face and to make her proud. </p>

	<br>

	<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;"> New sister in family finally here! As you can see, she's my eldest brother's wife. I call her 'Kak Tika'. Oh my god, her face looks like Mira Filzah. Am I wrong? Please not only me notice that. She is the most polite sister in my family after my brother-in-law. How can it possible? I have no idea. Most of the time, I need to be polite too when I want to talk to her because obviously I afraid I am going to hurt her with my words. HAHAHA. </p>

	<br>

	<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;"> Hanan Sofia is her name. My elder sister (the fourth one in siblings). She is so strong. I am not going to do body shaming here but please trust me she is super strong. I could fly like a wind if she tries to push me. HAHAHA or just I too small?? She was the one that defends me when I was bullied in primary school. I still remember how brave she was talking with anyone who tried to hurt me. I was speechless. I felt thankful for that. </p>

	<br>

	<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;"> THAT IS ME! Helloooo~~~~~ Ok, I already introduce myself in the 'About Me' page. Please refer that to get to know about me, because I might repeat the same things and you are going to feel tedious. xoxo!

	<br>

	<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;"> The last one iss my sister-in-law (wife to my second elder brother). She is Kedahan. Because of her, I am talking like Kedahan and fell in love with Kedah's accent. Since, I could not speak like Kelantanese even I study in Kelantan but I gave up when my friends said that my Kelantanese sounds so bad. HAHAHAHA It's okay at least I tried. So, I stand with Kedahan's accent. </p>

	<br>

	<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;"> OH, ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT THOSE KIDS!!! They are like my sisters since I am the youngest in family. Marissa Raisha (holding sweets and the tall one) and Maryam Rawdha (doing peace thing). They are my eldest sister's daughters. Both are too chicky and house always feel like having 20 people with their mouths. The house will suddenly feel empty when they return home. HAHAHAH
