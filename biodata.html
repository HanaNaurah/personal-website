	<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;"> Hello! This is me again. I have no idea how to start this page. But it's okay, I'll try my best. First of all, I'm Hana Naurah Binti Bahar. People call me 'Hana'. This 24th February I'll turns 21 years. Yes! I feel a little bit old than usual, at the same time, I do feel excited with upcoming things that I going to face, it could be hard and difficult but I believe that we called 'LIFE'. Actually, I don't know what to tell people about me, because it would be tedious. Forget to mention that I born in Klang, Selangor and grow up still in Selangor, such a wonderful city! </p>

	<center><p><b>My Inspiration</b></p></center>
	<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;"> Introduce you all "My Idol" known as Vivy Yusof, the founder of The dUCk Group and Lilit Woman. Those 2 brands are the famous brands in Malaysia. You must wondering why I choose Vivy as my inspiration in life? I got to know Vivy when I was 13 through Instagram. She inspired me until now to confidently speaks in English and she's like my English tutor that develop my communication skills as well. To be honest, she is someone that I truly proud when she introduces hijab in the world as symbol of muslim's wear and it proves world that we are not a terorist. Hijab is just a scarf and not even a weapon that can hurt anyone. Vivy also inspired me to study hard and be a successful woman no matter what I like to be as well as give as much as I can to help people around me. I might not knowing her well or secara dekat but as long as I can find her positivity sides, I think its good enough to influence me to be better.</p>
