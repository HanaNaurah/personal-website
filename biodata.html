	<center><p><b>Who's Hana?</b></p></center>
	<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;"> Hello! This is me again. I have no idea how to start this page. But it is okay, I will try my best. First of all, I am Hana Naurah Binti Bahar. People call me 'Hana'. This 24th February I will turns 21 years. Yes! I feel a little bit old than usual, at the same time, I do feel excited with upcoming things that I going to face, it could be hard and difficult but I believe that we call as 'LIFE'. Actually, I do not know what to tell people about me, because it would be tedious. Forget to mention that I born in Klang, Selangor and grow up still in Selangor, such a wonderful city! My dream job is to be an entrepreneur that selling various type of things including foods, clothes, skincare, and cosmetics. I want to have my own company and hire people! Such as a big dream. I know it. All I hope when one day I got to be an entrepreneur, I could help as much as people who in need. I know that there are billion of people who suffer a lot, and this is my intention for now.</p>

	<center><p><b>My Inspiration</b></p></center>
	<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;"> Introduce you "My Idol" known as Vivy Yusof, the founder of The dUCk Group and Lilit Woman. Those 2 brands are the famous brands in Malaysia. You must wondering why I choose Vivy as my inspiration in life? I got to know Vivy when I was 13 through Instagram. She inspired me until now to confidently speaks in English and she is like my indirect English tutor that develop my communication skills as well. To be honest, she is someone that I truly proud when she introduces hijab in the world as symbol of muslim's wear and it proves world that we are not a terorist. Hijab is just a scarf and not even a weapon that can hurt anyone. Vivy also inspired me to study hard and be a successful woman no matter what I like to be as well as give me as much as I can to help people around me. I might not knowing her well or closely but as long as I can find her positivity sides, I think it is good enough to influence me to be better.</p>

	<center><p><b>My Favorite Singer</b></p></center>
	<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;">My current favorite singer is Adele. Her songs give different vibes and the meaning really touches me. Her vocal (no one could deny this) totally amazing! My favorite song of her is '<cite>All I Ask'.</cite> The song is related to a person that will be lost her special person. This song actually refers to love relationship, it could be spouses (wife and husband). But for me, this song makes me remind of my family. I could not imagine how one day they will leave me. I probably will asking god (Allah S.W.T) give me some times to makes sure I could let them go with no regret ;( </p>
