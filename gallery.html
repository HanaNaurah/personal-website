SHOUT OUT TO ALL COMPANIES IN MALAYSIA, PLEASE HIRE MY FRIEND BECAUSE SHE IS INTELLIGENT! She has potential in accounting and she is one of my mentors in teaching me accountant. Accounting is obviously not my favorite subject during highschool, I hate it because it is too complicated to me. SAY NO TO ACCOUNTANT!</p><center>

	<center><b><p style="font-size: 12px;">2ND DAY OF RAYA: WE WERE AT GENTING HIGHLANDS</p></b></center>
		<center><p>Eid al-Fitr is not my fav day. I just celebrate it on the first day. I decided to have a trip to Genting Highlands with my family. It was my first time there. I would rate the place 8/10 because we were running out of time to experience all those games provided there. But I might have next trip to experience the themepark there in future!</p><center>

	<br>
	<center><img src="images/photo22.jpg" style="height: 360px; width: 300px;"></center>
	<center><b><p style="font-size: 12px;">BUKIT TINGGI IN PAHANG</p></b></center>
		<center><p>MOM AND ME IN BUKIT TINGGI, PAHANG. It was my first as well in Bukit Tinggi! The destination to the place was super challenging than the road to Cameron Highlands. It could be my last time to go there. There is nothing special for me unless the weather and scenary. </p><center>

	<br>
	<center><img src="images/photo23.jpg" style="height: 360px; width: 300px;"></center>
	<center><b><p style="font-size: 12px;">Still in Genting Highlands!</p></b></center>
		<center><p>We were at the Indoor Themepark of Genting Highlands. I love the all the lights and colors that applied in there. It makes the indoor themepark look interesting, but I think the price of tickets not worth it and a bit expensive. </p><center>

	<center><b><p style="font-size: 12px;">HAVING ABC WITH KINAH & ITS KIND OF TALKING TIME</p></b></center>
		<center><p>This time, Sakinah was at her worst part and I was the one could listen to her. I never seen her that sad before. She is the most happiest person that always laughing and shouting. So, this might seems serious. She is type of person that never show that she actually cares about her friends, but when we getting older and older, she always asking to story about my problems and saying that she will listen to me no matter what. Oh, I am melting now~~~~</p><center>
